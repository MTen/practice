Practice
========

Learning new languages by picking out a curated library, breaking it down to its base parts and using those "high level functions" as coding prompts when I understand the blocks.

Lego analogy: I'm breaking the languages down to all of those four and six block pieces rated for toddlers. I know I won't build anything elegant but I also won't choke on one of those fancy chandeliers. Most importantly, I'll be able to make things and stuff. More specifically things over stuff though.

Javascript
[ Started ] I'm starting off with jQuery Lite from the Angular library as a curated list of jQuery functions, learning their syntax and how to use them to build jQuery programs and I'll pull out the ajax calls from jQuery to isolate and understand those calls as well.

[ Todo] After I get acquainted to the core jQuery languages I'm going to read the production version (non commented) version of Backbone and comment it to my understanding.

[ Todo ] Build a few CRUD mockups of other popular sites using backbone/rails & jquery.

[ Todo ] Deconstruct jQuery functions to their base components.
